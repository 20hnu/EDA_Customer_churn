# Cleaning dataset

All columns seem fine but 'TotalCharges' column contains some null values
and dtype as 'Object'.
So the column is changes in 'float' and null values are imputed by using this formula:
TotalCharges = MonthlyCharges * tenure

* InternetService, OnlineSecurity, OnlineBackup, DeviceProtection, StreamingTV, StreamingMovies, TechSupport have same number of rows associated to same type of value.
* Only one column can be utilized while preparing data for modeling.
* Also they will give similar type of analysis.

The value counts of those columns are exactly same for each column, which is given below:
            No                     2785
            Yes                    2732
            No internet service    1526
